# CBNST-Programs

This repository contains various C programs for Computational and Numerical Methods in Science and Technology (CBNST). Each program implements different numerical methods, such as Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta, Gauss Elimination, and Simpson's Rules, among others. These are essential tools for solving equations, interpolation, and numerical integration in computational mathematics.
